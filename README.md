Market basket analysis will help sales and marketing teams develop more effective product placement, pricing, cross-sell, and up-sell tactics. It would help the store optimize sales strategies, inventory management, and customer experience by leveraging patterns in customer purchase behavior.

MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS

- The most commonly purchased items include whole milk, other vegetables, rolls/buns, soda, and yogurt.
- There's a notable correlation between the purchase of frankfurters and other vegetables, indicated by a lift of 0.1. This implies that customers who purchase frankfurters are 10% more inclined to buy other vegetables compared to those who don't buy frankfurters.
- There's a purchasing pattern where sausages often accompany yogurt in shopping baskets, suggesting a tendency among customers who buy sausages to also purchase yogurt.
- Additionally, there's a moderate association observed between the purchase of soda and sausages.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

- Encourage higher volume purchases by introducing incentives for customers buying in larger quantities. This strategy aims to attract those who frequently purchase large amounts while still catering to those who buy smaller quantities.
- Investigate the significant percentage of customers who have made fewer than four purchases. Understanding whether this is due to customer turnover or occasional bulk purchases can inform targeted retention efforts.
- Implement a customer segmentation approach considering shopping frequency and average basket size. This allows tailored strategies: incentivizing infrequent shoppers to return more often and rewarding loyal, frequent buyers with exclusive perks.
- Leverage seasonal trends for strategic marketing campaigns, identifying and capitalizing on months with lower sales through targeted promotions.
- Group frequently purchased items together, like sausages and soda or other vegetables and frankfurters, to streamline shopping experiences and potentially boost sales through convenient pairings.
- Employ cross-selling promotions to highlight complementary products. Offer discounts on related items when a customer purchases a specific product or use personalized notifications based on past purchases to suggest items of interest.
